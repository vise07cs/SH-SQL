# What is Normalization in DBMS?

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy (duplicate data) and improve data integrity (consistency and accuracy).

Itâ€™s done by dividing a large table into smaller related tables and defining relationships between them using keys.


Why do we need Normalization?

(1) Avoid data redundancy (no storing same info multiple times).

(2)Ensure data integrity (data remains consistent across the DB).

(3)Efficient storage (no unnecessary duplication).

(4)Easier maintenance (updates happen in one place).

(5)Better query performance (smaller tables, less duplication).

A Database (DB) is an organized collection of data

Why do we need a Database?

 ** Without a database:

Data is scattered → difficult to manage.

Searching is slow.

Updating one record may cause inconsistency.

Security is poor (anyone can open the file).

 ** With a database:

Data is organized in tables.

Searching is very fast.

Data integrity (consistency) is maintained.

Security (user/password, permissions).

Can handle millions of records easily.




DBMS = Database Management System (Dbase , foxPro, MS access)

RDBMS=Relational DBMS(oracle, MSsql,mySQL) --> provides better performance --> we can build relations between the tables 

DBMS and RDBMS are concepts , not a software

MySQL is the product of Oracle


------------------------------

Database = place to store a data 

 -------------------------
 Types of Databases

Mainly 2 categories:

(a) Relational Database (RDBMS)

Data stored in tables (rows & columns).

Relationships between tables.

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

(b) Non-Relational Database (NoSQL)

Data stored as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, etc.

Not table-based.

Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.

📌 When to use what?

RDBMS (SQL) → When data is structured (like Banking, E-commerce, HR systems).

NoSQL → When data is semi-structured or unstructured (like social media feeds, logs, IoT data).



any application will have (Frontend(UI) , Backend(Business Logic) , DB layer )



To communicate with DB we need some language 



SQL = Structured Query Language.

A language to communicate with RDBMS databases.

With SQL, you can:

Create databases and tables.

Insert, update, delete data.

Query (retrieve) specific information.

Control user access.

Handle transactions.

💡 Example: If you want “List of all employees with salary > 50,000”, you can get it in 1 line SQL query instead of manually searching thousands of records.


IS SQL our only option ?

Excel/CSV → Good for very small data, but limited.

Programming languages (Python/Java) → Can handle data, but not optimized for querying millions of rows efficiently.

NoSQL → Powerful for flexible data, but lacks strict structure.

📌 That’s why SQL is still the king for structured data (over 80% of companies use it daily).
